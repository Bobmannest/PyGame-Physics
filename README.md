This is a simple physics demo that uses Python Object Oriented Programming to create ball objects which can freely move around and collide 
with eachother in real time. 

- Balls can have different sizes and I have used random number generation to spawn them in with random colors and sizes.
- Balls also have masses which depend on their radius and gravity will apply accordingly with the different masses
- Balls will detect collisions with other balls in real time
- As part of the demo, the mouse can be used to interact with the balls by drawing them in towards the mouse which will help to visually display
  the range of movements and collisions that balls can have

TODO) In the future I might allow ball collisions to be affected by the difference in ball masses. For example, a smaller ball colliding with a more
massive ball will result in the smaller ball getting pushed back with a higher velocity than the more massive ball.
